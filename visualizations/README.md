# Project Data and Preprocessing

This document outlines the data sources and preprocessing pipeline required to reproduce the main experimental results and figures from our paper.

## Data Sources

The analyses in this project rely on publicly available data from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), the Network of Cancer Genes (NCG), gene set enrichment analysis performed using g:Profiler, and outputs generated by the model itself.

### 1. Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)

The raw data files were downloaded from the official CTD downloads page on June 5, 2025:
[https://ctdbase.org/downloads/](https://ctdbase.org/downloads/)

The following specific files were originally downloaded:

* **Disease Vocabulary:** `CTD_diseases.obo.gz`
    * **Source Section on CTD:** Disease vocabulary (MEDIC)
    * **Note:** This file was manually converted to `CTD_diseases.tsv` (provided in the `CTD_Association_data/` directory) before preprocessing.

* **Disease-Pathway Associations:** `CTD_diseases_pathways.tsv.gz`
    * **Source Section on CTD:** Disease–pathway associations
    * **Note:** The raw `.tsv.gz` file is provided in the `CTD_Association_data/` directory.

* **Phenotype-Disease Associations:** `CTD_Phenotype-Disease_biological_process_associations.tsv.gz`
    * **Source Section on CTD:** Phenotype (GO)–Disease Inference Networks
    * **Note:** Due to its large size, this raw file is not included in the repository.

To ensure reproducibility without requiring large downloads, all necessary preprocessed files derived from the sources above are already included in the `CTD_Association_data_preprocessed/` directory. The subsequent analysis scripts use these cleaned files directly.

### 2. Network of Cancer Genes (NCG)

* **Annotation File:** `NCG_cancerdrivers_annotation_supporting_evidence.tsv`
    * **Source:** Downloaded from the [Network of Cancer Genes (NCG)](http://network-cancer-genes.org/download.php) (version 7.2 or similar) on June 10, 2025.
    * **Usage:** Used to filter and identify potential cancer driver genes that are not already annotated in major databases. (Script: `filtering_ncg_potential_genes.py`)

### 3. Gene Lists (Used for Categorization and Filtering)

* `./Data/796true.txt`: List of known driver genes.
* `./Data/2187false.txt`: List of non-driver genes.

### 4. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (g:Profiler)

Enrichment analysis is performed on a list of predicted driver genes.

* **Input Gene List:**
    * `./node_prediction_pancancer/predicted_top_genes.txt`
    * Contains predicted driver genes (known drivers removed) used as the query for enrichment analysis.

* **Tool:**
    * Analysis conducted using the **g:Profiler** Python library (`gprofiler-official`).
    * **Sources queried:** Gene Ontology (GO:BP - Biological Process, GO:CC - Cellular Component, GO:MF - Molecular Function) and KEGG pathways.

### 5. Derived Data for Analysis and Visualization

This section lists the data files required as input for the various visualization scripts. These files contain intermediate outputs from the model, such as node embeddings and attention weights.

* `./node_prediction_pancancer/node_embeddings.csv`: Contains node embeddings generated by the model, along with true labels and predicted probabilities. Used for UMAP and KDE plots.

* `./node_prediction_pancancer/attn_info.pt`: Contains model-generated attention weights, along with test indices and true labels. Used for attention visualization scripts (`visualize_average_attention_weight.py`, `visualize_attention_clustermap.py`).

* `./node_prediction_pancancer/prediction_genes_STRING/` & `./node_prediction_pancancer/prediction_genes_CPDB/`: Directories containing prediction scores per gene for each fold (`predictions_fold_*.txt`). Used for the gene category plot.

**Generating the Data:**
These two files (`node_embeddings.csv` and `attn_info.pt`) can be generated by running the `save_visualization_data.py` script, which utilizes the modified model definition in `model_with_outputs.py` and helper functions in `utils.py`..

Example command to generate the data using the STRING network for pan-cancer:
```bash
python save_visualization_data.py STRING pan-cancer
```

## Preprocessing and Analysis Pipeline

The raw data is processed through a series of scripts to generate the final data used for visualization and analysis. The pipeline is organized into four main stages:

1.  **Enrichment Analysis Pipeline**
    * **CTD Data Cleaning:** (`enrichment_analysis_1_CTD_file_preprocessing.py`, `enrichment_analysis_2_CTD_GO_KEGG_preprocessing.py`)
        * These scripts process the raw TSV files from the `CTD_Association_data/` directory (e.g., `CTD_diseases.tsv`, `CTD_diseases_pathways.tsv`).
        * They extract essential columns and create cleaned, standardized TSV files. The outputs are stored in the `CTD_Association_data_preprocessed/` directory, which are then used by subsequent scripts.

    * **Enrichment Analysis:** (`enrichment_analysis_3_gprofiler.py`)
       * Uses `predicted_top_genes.txt` as input for g:Profiler.
       * Performs enrichment analysis against GO and KEGG, saving the top 15 terms for each category (BP, CC, MF, KEGG) into `.csv` files in `enrichment_analysis_results/`.

    * **Cancer Term Filtering:** (`enrichment_analysis_4_extract_cancer_related_term.py`)
       * Uses the cleaned CTD data and the enrichment `.csv` results.
       * Filters enrichment terms for cancer relevance using MeSH hierarchy and keyword matching.
       * **Outputs:** `cancer_related_terms_with_diseaseids.csv` (structured data) and `cancer_related_terms_with_diseaseids.txt` (human-readable version).

    * **Enrichment Results Visualization:** (`enrichment_analysis_5_visualize_enrichment_analysis_result.py`)
       * Reads the `top_15_*.csv` enrichment results and the `cancer_related_terms_with_diseaseids.txt` file.
       * Generates bar plots for each category, highlighting cancer-related terms in bold.
       * **Output:** Saves plots as `.png` files in `enrichment_final_results/`.


2.  **Node Embedding Visualization**
    * **UMAP Visualization:** (`visualize_node_embedding.py`)
       * Takes the `node_embeddings.csv` file as input.
       * Generates a 2D UMAP scatter plot, coloring points by their true label (Driver/Non-driver).
       * **Output:** `figures/umap_visualization.jpg`.
         
    * **KDE Visualization:** (`visualize_node_embedding_all_pairwise_cosine_distance.py`)
       * Also uses the `node_embeddings.csv` file.
       * Calculates and plots the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) of pairwise cosine distances between embeddings within and between Driver/Non-driver groups.
       * **Output:** `figures/kde_distance_plot.jpg`.

3.  **Gene Category Analysis and Visualization**
    * **Potential Driver Gene Filtering:** (`filtering_ncg_potential_genes.py`)
       * Takes the NCG annotation file, known driver (`796true.txt`), and non-driver (`2187false.txt`) lists as input.
       * Filters the NCG list to identify genes not present in major cancer gene databases *and* not already labeled as known drivers or non-drivers.
       * **Output:** `node_prediction_pancancer/potential_driver_genes_ncg7.2.txt` - A list of potential novel driver candidates.
         
    * **Gene Category Prediction Score Visualization:** (`visualize_category_prediction_plot.py`)
       * Reads prediction scores and uses the `796true.txt`, `2187false.txt`, and `potential_driver_genes_ncg7.2.txt` lists to categorize genes.
       * Generates a bar plot comparing the average prediction score for each gene category (Known Driver, Potential Driver, etc.) for both STRING and CPDB networks.
       * **Output:** `figures/predicted_gene_category.jpg`.

4.  **Attention Mechanism Visualization**
    * **Average Attention Weight Visualization:** (`visualize_average_attention_weight.py`)
       * Takes the `attn_info.pt` file as input.
       * Calculates the mean and standard deviation of attention weights for each network type (PPI, Pathway, GO) across all test set genes.
       * **Output:** A bar plot (`figures/avg_attention_weight.jpg`) visualizing these average weights.
         
    * **Attention Weight Clustermap Visualization:** (`visualize_attention_clustermap.py`)
       * Also uses the `attn_info.pt` file.
       * Generates a clustered heatmap (clustermap) of the standardized attention weights for a sample of individual genes.
       * Rows are colored by their true label (Driver/Non-driver) to visualize attention patterns.
       * **Output:** A clustermap image (`figures/clustermap_attention.jpg`).
